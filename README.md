#cpp11-memcached
This is a toy memcached server that simply supports set and get requests, written as an opportunity to write some more c++11.

##Building
Requirements:

* C++11 compatible compiler
* CMake
* Boost
* Node.js (optional, for running some of the local tests)

```
mkdir build && cd buid
cmake ..
make
./main
```

For Boost & Cmake, you can install it on OSX with `brew install boost cmake` and on Ubuntu with `sudo aptitude install cmake libboost-all-dev`.

###CAS Field
The CAS field is used to signal atomicity.  From the [memcached spec](https://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/MemcacheBinaryProtocol), section 4.3 "Set, Add, Replace":

```
If the Data Version Check (CAS) is nonzero, the requested operation
MUST only succeed if the item exists and has a CAS value identical to
the provided value.
```

CAS is short for [Compare And Swap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap), a common atomic operation that only updates a value if the writer has the most up to date value.  For example, if thread A writes to a location, then thread B writes to the same location, thread A's subsequent CAS operation will fail.

###Tradeoffs
1. This code assumes all key value pairs can fit into memory on this machine.  This doesn't scale well beyond a single machine.  Moving to a distributed message queue might be better, but adds [complexity in keeping all caches coherent](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html).
2. One thread is spawned per connection.  This adds latency as the thread is being spawned, and can easily use up system resources in a DoS attack.  Instead, a thread pool should be used.
3. Connections are handled synchronously.  This hurts throughput, but makes the code slightly simpler.  Boost asio has support for async.
4. All threads share a key value store.  Shared memory is juggling razors.  Also, I simply wrap access to the key value store in a mutex.  A thread must acquire the mutex once for a set operation and twice for a get operation.  The use of a properly programmed concurrent map would be better, like from [libcds](https://github.com/khizmax/libcds) or even the basic example from [C++ Concurrency in Action: Practical Multithreading](http://www.cplusplusconcurrencyinaction.com/).

###Formatting
Each C++ source and header is run through `clang-format -i `find . -name '*.cpp'`.
